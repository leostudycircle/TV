<p> </p>
<p> A design thinker by calling, and an engineer and decision sciences practitioner by training, I devoted a large part of my working career to getting to better understand people, business, software and operations alignment.</p>

Writing @ Raising Butterflies. I'm asking more questions here than penning down the answers. Read the foundational story here
<h6>My life's Philosophy</h6>

<p>The clear absolutes for my life are the amount of control I have on my thinking and choice faculties. These absolutes have taken an evolved meaning and bought me closer to a working philosophy for my daily outset. If you know me already you already know the words I live by.</p>

> Believer in the design of the Universe, skeptic of the everyday design of things; living by better Design .</p>


My Professional experience.



<p>A decade long consulting career to an entrepreneurial one has in essence transitioned from:
Optimizing enterprise software
Advising and designing improved controls across businesses operations, policies, processes and software h5(to)h5 designing better experiences and designing against misuse of digital products from ground up.</p>

<p>I can easily shift my analysis frames from forest to trees and the weeds and I deeply enjoy understanding things from the foundational and root-cause thinking about problems. I particularly enjoy figuring problems through methodologies, frameworks, diversity in thinking standpoint.</p>

##Strengths

<p>- Lean Operations & Process Automation</p>
<p>- UX/CX Research & Experience</p>
<p>- Data Analytics</p>
