<p>This website is a extended project from my 2003 initiation into a Spiritual path, the only path of awakening and my daily active role as a Maths, Physics and Chemistry teacher. Hello.
Some of you would know me as Teacher Manjunath Juloori. My teaching world that began with with setting up Leo Study Circle in the year 1990 has slowly merged into the Spiritual realm as my students curiosity arose and of late has been a regularly held weekly session in my ancient, humble abode - located in Secunderabad, India.</p>

<p>You can take a look at some of the pictures to get a view of things, which I have hesitatingly asked my digital students to post for public view.</p>
